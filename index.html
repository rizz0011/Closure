    <h1>Closure</h1>
    <p>
      Closure is the combination of function bundled together with references to
      it's surrounding state (the lexical enviornemt). We can also say closure
      give us to access an outer scope to inner scope
    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>Use Cases of Closure:</p>
      <li>
        Private Variables: Closure are commonly used to create private variables
        and functions within an outer function,
      </li>
      <li>preventing direct access from outside the scope.</li>
      <li>
        Callback Functions: Closure are useful in callback patterns, where a
        function needs to remember and access its surrounding state after it is
        passed as a callback.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <script>
      //Some example of closure

      function outer() {
        var name = "javascript";
        function inner() {
          console.log(name);
        }
        inner();
      }
      outer();

      function x() {
        let a = 7;
        return function y() {
          console.log(a);
        };
      }
      var z = x();
      console.log(z);

      function x() {
        let a = 7;
        function y() {
          console.log(a);
        }
        a = 120;
        a = 100;
        return y;
      }
      var z = x();
      console.log(z);
      z();
